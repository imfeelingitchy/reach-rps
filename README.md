# Rock Paper Scissors

This is my iteration of the [Reach RPS Tutorial](https://docs.reach.sh/tut/rps/), created in order to participate in Reach's [Umoja 3 Bounty Hack](https://events.reach.sh/decentralized-umoja-3). Although the smart contract itself is the same (as per their requirement), I have taken the liberty to convert the class-based React components in their tutorial to functional ones, which, in my opinion, makes the code a lot more readable.
